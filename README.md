## MDDN 242 2023 Assignment 2

For this project i wanted to only use shapes/objects with code and i wanted to create a minimalistic design, i originally had an idea of pyrimads with an eye design but i couldnt think of a good way to evolve the design into multiple letters and numbers so i decided to create this starry night design which uses a moon and starlight objects.

Each of my letters is composed with two arcs, a rectangle and three circles.
shapes :
- Moon (arc) uses a grey color.
- Moon craters (three circles) uses a darker grey color.
- Starlight (Rectangle) uses a yellow color for the yellow starlights.
- Starlight 2 (Arc) uses a yellow color for the yellow starlights.

the editor really helped me to visualise the process of creating each individual letter/number, the only shapes which are set to a fixed postition are the stars in the background and the main moon.

the parameters i used to edit:
moon arcStart : beginning of moon Arc shape.
moon arcEnd : ending of moon Arc Shape.

starlight circX : X position of starlight arc shape.
starlight circY : Y position of starlight arc shape.
starlight circSize : size of starlight arc shape.
starlight circStart : beginning of starlight arc shape.
starlight circEnd : ending of starlight arc shape.

starlight rectX : X position of starlight rectangle shape.
starlight rectY : Y position of starlight rectangle shape.
starlight rectWidth : Width of starlight rectangle shape.
starlight rectHeight : Height of starlight rectangle shape.
starlight rectRotate : Rotation of starlight rectangle shape.

moonspot 1X : X position of moonspot 1 circle shape.
moonspot 1Y : Y position of moonspot 1 circle shape.
moonspot 2X : X position of moonspot 2 circle shape.
moonspot 2Y : Y position of moonspot 2 circle shape.
moonspot 3X : X position of moonspot 3 circle shape.
moonspot 3Y : Y position of moonspot 3 circle shape.
